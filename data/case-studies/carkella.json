By this point, I had been using Bootstrap for around 6 months and after researching some of my favorites sites, I noticed they were using Bootstrap without the ugly looking css style names. This is where I found Bootstraps utility functions, allowing me to create custom class names, making the code markup much more human readable. This is how I build my sites to this day. "
